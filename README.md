**TrueSafe** is not just another whitelist extension. It's a proactive security platform designed for power users, developers, and security-conscious individuals who need granular control over browser security warnings. It goes beyond simple whitelisting by providing multiple layers of intelligent diagnostics and security checks to help you make informed decisions.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository is structured to support multiple browsers from a shared core logic.

---

## ü¶Ä WebAssembly Module

The high-performance content analyzer is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. If you wish to modify its logic, you'll need to have the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) installed.

To re-compile the module, navigate to the `/wasm-hasher` directory and run:
`wasm-pack build --target web`

Then, copy the generated files from `/wasm-hasher/pkg` into both the `/chrome` and `/firefox` directories.
